Hi there!
Your approach to the problem, implementation, and the outcome of this challenge will be used to assess your technical skills.

Project description & instructions:
The goal of the challenge is to match customer's pickup requests with available non-profit recipients.
At the basic and conceptual level, implementation of this challenge replicates a simplified version of our current algorithm used by our operations team.

You are given two data sources (Pickups and Recipients), both of which are CSV files.
You must be able to correctly parse through the given CSV files and perform appropriate operations to achieve your goal.

Feel free to use any libraries and frameworks to achieve your goal of this challenge.

The distance between a pickup and recipient must be within 5 miles. Date & time is provided for each of the pickup requests and is the earliest promised time. The latest promised time is one hour added to it. A matched recipient must be open between the earliest and latest promised times. For each pickup-to-recipient(s) match(es), sort by the most to least favorable recipients. It is up to you on deciding how you want to define a “favorable recipient.” Both data sources include geo-coordinates, which you will need to use to calculate the distance between them.
Result of matches must be stored as one or more CSV files. It is up to you on how you’d like to structure the CSV output file(s).

Break down your implementation into smaller parts by writing them as functions.
Write test cases for each of the functions you implement and perform unit tests as necessary.
It’s crucial that you write enough but useful test cases. Each of your test cases will be reviewed to assess test coverages and thoroughness.


While you are working to implement this challenge, you must document your entire work: your initial thoughts, plans, approach, unit test results, overall result, results analysis, and conclusion. It is highly recommended that your documentation is as thorough as possible.

Package up your implementation source code (Github is highly recommended) so that it can be reviewed.
Your documentation can be in the form of a text file or as a git markdown.
Make sure to also document instructions for running your code from our end.

Things to keep in mind:
- Dropoff at a recipient must be during their stated hours of operation.
- Recipients can only accept certain categories of food. This is a strict requirement.
- There may be multiple or no recipients at all for each pickups.


Good luck!
